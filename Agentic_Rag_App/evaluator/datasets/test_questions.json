      "context": "The 'Negotiation Plan' is a document detailing (but not  limited to)  the  purpose,  the  target,  and  the  proposed methodology  of  negotiations. The document provides details of the negotiation strategies that may be used.\n\nThe 'Documents' tab of the 'Sourcing Project' contains a 'Negotiation Plan' document which may be downloaded, completed, and uploaded by the 'Project Owner'. Below is the structure of this document:\n\nTable 2.3.9 'Negotiation Plan' document sections\n\n| Section Name            | Description                                                                             |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1. Data Collation       | To create a Bid Summary for all the offers received from the shortlisted Bidders.       |\n| 2. Defining Needs       | To provide a summary of the Entity and Bidder needs to be addressed during negotiation. |\n| 3. Negotiation Case     | To document the most beneficial and achievable solution.                                |\n| 4. Estimate proportions | To create a list of points of leverage to be used during negotiation.                   |\n| 5. Planning             | To document the team and schedule of negotiation.                                       |\n| 6. Results              | To summarize the negotiation outcomes.                                                  |\n\nThe 'Project Owner' may use the 'Negotiation Plan' template provided in the 'Sourcing Project' or other approved template covering the required elements.\n\nThe 'Project Owner' establishes a team to conduct negotiations. A 'Negotiations Team' may include  (but  not  limited  to)  Lead  Negotiator,  Summarizer,  Observer,  Minutes  Taker,  Subject Matter Expert, Financial Analyst, and Legal Advisor. The 'Negotiations Team' is encouraged to:\n\n- a. Identify  the  Maximum Supportable Situation (MSS), Least Acceptable Solution (LAS), and Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement (BATNA).\n- b. Collect and analyze industry and competitor information.\n- c. Make a list of the most critical arguments and understand the points of leverage.\n- d. Plan the details of the negotiations and conduct internal trial runs, if required.\n\nImportant  Note:  An  individual  can  perform  multiple  roles  within  the  'Negotiations  Team'  (if required). The 'Negotiations Team' must consist of a minimum of two members.\n\n## 3) Invite Suppliers and conduct negotiations\n\nThe  'Project  Owner'  invites  identified Suppliers for  negotiations  via  the  'Message  Board' functionality.  Post-negotiations,  if  an  agreement  is  reached  between  the Supplier and  the Procurement ,  the  'Project  Owner'  publishes  the  post  negotiation  Sourcing  Event  to  record updated Supplier responses.\n\nIn cases an agreement cannot be reached post-negotiations, the 'Project Owner' may take one of the following approaches:\n\n- a. If  the  original  bids  are  acceptable,  the  'Project  Owner'  proceeds  to  the  'Approve Recommendation of Award' task considering the original bids.\n- b. If the original bids are unacceptable, the 'Project Owner' cancels the Sourcing Event. The 'Project Owner' may modify the 'Sourcing Strategy' or just conduct another Sourcing Event, to obtain the desired results.\n\niii. (S) Roles and Responsibilities\n\n| Role              | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Project Owner     | 1.

Baseline Spend\n\nBaseline Spend is based on two parameters and is calculated as following:\n\nBaseline Spend = Total Volume * Baseline Unit Price\n\nTotal volume may be known or unknown. However, two methods can be used for calculations to estimate volume, as detailed:\n\nTable 1.4.2 Volume Estimation Methodologies\n\n| Method                      | Situation           | Method                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Demand Plan Forecast Volume | Forecast is known   | • 100% of forecast volume for the specific spend area                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Historic forecast volume    | Forecast is unknown | • 50% of historic volume + (50% of historic volume * category demand growth forecast %) In general, previous year volumes are used as historic volumes; if this data is not available, the period that is used to calculate historic volume should be mentioned. |\n\nBaseline unit price may be estimated using one of the following methodologies:\n\n## i. Historic price baseline\n\nHistoric price baseline is relevant when the goods/services/projects were purchased previously (in last year). Below are the details of various methods to create a historic price baseline:\n\nTable 1.4.3 Historic Baseline Price Calculation Methodologies\n\n| Price Method                                                                                                  | Situation                                                                                                              | Method                      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Used where market is not volatile (applicable for components and traded items like office furniture, etc.).   | • Last actual paid price in the Purchase Order (PO), or • Contracted price, if last actual paid price is not available | Last Price Paid             |\n| Used in case of a volatile market (applicable for e.g., 100% index-based commodities)                         | • Average Price paid over the last year                                                                                | Average Price               |\n| Used in case of a volatile market (Commodities for which transparent and independent index are not available) | • Average Price of historical offers after clarification from the Suppliers                                            | Average quoted Market Price |\n\n## ii. Comparable price baseline\n\nIf a certain goods/service has not been purchased previously, historic price baseline cannot be established. In such cases, the baseline price can be estimated using comparable goods/services/projects  (identical  or  similar  specifications)  where  the  price  is  known.  (e.g., estimating  the  baseline  price  for  a  car  rental  service  by  comparing  it  with  similar  services previously purchased by another Entity).\n\n## iii. New price baseline\n\nIf  neither  a  historic  nor  a  comparable  baseline  can  be  established,  a  new  baseline  can  be developed based on the initial RFI or RFP/RFQ responses provided by the Suppliers .",

These sources may include (but not limited to):\n\n## b1. Primary Sources\n\n- End-Users and buyers of goods/services/projects\n- Suppliers and industry associations\n\n## b2. Secondary Sources\n\n- Internet searches and company-specific publications\n- Online databases and media sources\n- Specialist public sector organisations\n- Private-sector research organisations\n- c. It  is  recommended  that  publicly  available  secondary  sources  are  researched  before conducting primary research. The Category Manager should explore paid market research reports only if publicly available secondary sources and primary sources are not sufficient.\n- d. The Category Manager may either use the provided template for 'Internal Category Profile' and 'External Market Analysis' or another approved template covering required elements.\n\n## ii. Create 'Category Strategy'\n\n- a. The 'Internal Category Profile' and 'External Category Analysis' provide actionable insights that serve as inputs to the 'Category Strategy'.\n- b. 'Category Strategy' should cover (but not limited to) following sections:\n\n## b1. Category Segmentation\n\nCategory Segmentation depends on the following criteria:\n\n- I. Criticality  of  the  Category is  determined  by  factors  such  as  (but  not  limited  to) impact on Entity's operations in case of unavailability, and critical factors such as Health, Safety and Environment.\n- II. Complexity  of  the  Category defines  the  inherent  nature  of  a  category  that  is governed by several factors including (but not limited to) availability of Suppliers, market  structure  (monopolistic,  oligopolistic,  competitive  etc.),  ability  to  switch Suppliers ,  possibility  of  substitution,  lead  times  and  regulations  governing  the category.\n\nBased on above parameters, the category may be classified into the following segments:\n\nFigure 2.2.1 Category Segmentation\n\n## b2. Strategic Levers\n\nBased on the Category Segmentation, category optimization  and  improvement strategies (and associated levers) are selected. These strategies (and associated levers) are divided into following areas:\n\n- I. Usage and Innovation\n- II. Price\n- III. Process and Operational Efficiency\n- IV.
